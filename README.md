## Project Structure
* __node_modules:__ This folder contains all the dependencies of your project. When you install packages using npm, they are stored here.

* __public:__ This folder contains static assets like Vite.svg, HTML files, images, and other resources that don't need to be processed by webpack. 

* __src:__ This is where the source code of your React application resides. It typically contains the following subfolders:

1. *components:* This folder contains reusable React components that make up our application's UI. Each component folder contains the subfolders of styles, CSS files or preprocessor files for styling your components.
2. *pages:* This folder contains React components that represent different pages/routes of our application.
3. *assets:* This folder holds static assets like images, fonts, or other media files used in your application.
4. *services:* This folder may contain modules for interacting with external services or APIs, in this case an archive of Vanilla JS.

* __tests:__ This folder may contains tests files for unit or integration testing your components and utilities.
* __package.json and package-lock.json:__ These files contain metadata about your project and its dependencies. They also include scripts for running various tasks like starting the development server or building the production bundle.
* __.gitignore:__ Specifies files and folders ignored by Git to prevent irrelevant or automatically generated files from being tracked.
* __eslintrc.cjs:__ Configuration file for ESLint, a tool that identifies and fixes errors in JavaScript code based on predefined rules.
