* Copy code in your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/leiteway/Hollywow-API.git`
* Copy code in your terminal: `cd Hollywow-API`
To enter the repository folder.

2. **Create the file ¬¥.env¬¥**
   
* Create the file ¬¥.env¬¥ located in the folder "Hollywow-API"
* Copy the information placed on ¬¥.env_example¬¥ and fill it with your personal data

3. **Install Dependencies:**
